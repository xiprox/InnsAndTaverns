# Inns and Taverns

![readme image](./.github/assets/readme.jpg)

For now, adds a room to the White Orchard Inn where you can sleep in a bed and access your stash. The plan is to add more rooms/beds in more places.

Sleeping gives you a max health bonus depending on bed level (very poor grants none, poor a little, rich a lot, etc.).

Inns with stables grant a stamina bonus for Roach.
