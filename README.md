# Inns and Taverns

![readme image](./.github/assets/readme.jpg)

For now, adds a room to the White Orchard Inn where you can sleep in a bed and access your stash.

I hope to add "sleepable" beds/rooms to more places in the game, as well as making it so that sleeping in such places gives you buffs (e.g. an inn with stables gives you that bonus).
